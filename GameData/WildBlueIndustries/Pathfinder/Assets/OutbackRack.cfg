description = The Outback Rack is specifically designed to store the Outback Extravehicular Support Pack on the exterior of a vessel. From there, you'll be able to configure the Outback as desired and fill it with resources. It's a great alternative for the non-engineer who can't simply bolt the Outback to the ship.
