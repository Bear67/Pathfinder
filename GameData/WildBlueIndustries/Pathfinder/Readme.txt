Orbiting satellites are great for detecting resources from space, but advanced sensors take a long time to research. With this update, Pathfinder introduces resource scanning tech earlier in the game- assuming it works. Additionally, the Geology Lab can do things that the stock surface scanner can- and more if you staff it right. Finally, the new Outback gives you a handy way to haul small amounts of resources around without lugging the Buckboard.

New Parts
- Added the T.E.R.R.A.I.N. Geo Scanner. If it breaks down, you'll have to repair it. Don't want it to break? You can change it in the settings menu. 
- Added the Outback Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP). It's great for hauling a small amount of resources around, and it's EVA friendly. It can be attached to the exterior of a vessel by pressing the "H" key, and detached using the "G" key. Anybody can use it.

Ponderosa
- Cleaned up the Ponderosa right-click menu and moved a lot of functionality to the Ponderosa Operations window. Access it via the Manage Operations button in the right-click menu.

Pathfinder Geology Lab
- The Geology Lab is now controlled through the Operations window. Simply right-click on the Ponderosa, press the Manage Operations button, and press the Show button to manage the Geology Lab.
- The Geology Lab can now perform a surface analysis of the biome if properly staffed.
- If you have the Impact mod (I recommend it), the Geology Lab can lend its seismometer to the cause if properly staffed.

Templates
- Added the Prime Flux Battery template to the Buckboard and Outback, named after Prime Flux, who suggested the idea. Thanks Prime Flux! :)

ToolTips & Settings
- Added a tooltip to remind players that the requirement to pay for redecorating/inflating the Ponderosa can be turned off.
- The Settings window can now be toggled using the modifier key (which defaults to the Alt key on Windows) plus P instead of being hard coded to the Alt key.

Resources & Storage
- Added the PhotoMaterials resource for taking pictures.
- Adjusted the Buckboard's storage capacity when not being used to store KIS items.
- You can now access the Chuckwagon's inventory from inside the module.

KIS/KAS
- Updated the saddle to account for the latest changes in KIS.
- Thanks to the latest version of KIS, non-engineers can attach the drill to a vessel with the "H" key and grab it with the "G" key.

0.1.4: Raw Hide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCRae5mRoRE

Developer Notes: When I started working on Multipurpose Colony Modules, I always intended to have the player spend resources to reconfigure the module. Its successor, Pathfinder, finally realizes that vision. Similarly, certain templates require a specific skill to reconfigure the module into its new configuration.

The new requirements add a new challenge to the gameplay without overly complicating the system. But as always, it’s your game, your choice, so you can disable these requirements if you prefer not to play with them. Simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder settings window, and uncheck the box next to “requires resources to reconfigure.” If you uncheck the box, the Ponderosa won’t require resources to inflate and outfit the module either. Similarly, you can disable the skill requirement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The directory structure has changed. Please delete the WildBlueIndustries folder before installing this update.
NOTE: Please pack up your Ponderosas before applying this patch.

- The Ponderosa now requires RocketParts to inflate the module and to reconfigure it. Be sure to have an ample supply of RocketParts on your vessel. If you prefer to not use this feature, simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder Settings window to disable it.
- Added the Conestoga Multipurpose Logistics Module (MLM). The Conestoga holds a lot more stuff than the Buckboard, but it’s not very hand-portable.
- Added the Mineshaft Portable Crew Tube (PCT). Mount one on each Ponderosa that you want to connect to, and then link them together, just like the KAS pipe.
- Added the Ponderosa Habitat template to the Ponderosa. It will be helpful in the future, but right now it's decorative.

0.1.3: Dead Or Alive

NOTE: Please pack up your base before applying this patch.
- Adjusted the Buckboard storage capacity to something more reasonable and carryable.
- Removed attach_node from the Saddle; I think that's causing the Kraken to take notice.
- You can now access the Ponderosa's inventory from inside the module as well as during EVA.

0.1.1: Blaze Of Glory

Want to camp out? Then take along the Ponderosa Inflatable Crew Module (ICM)! First bolt a Saddle into the ground, then saddle up the Ponderosa. The ICM comes outfitted with the Pathfinder Geology Lab, but other configurations are possible. And if you need supplies, don't forget to bring along the Buckboard shipping container.

- Added the Saddle Mini-Slab. Attach this to the ground.
- Added the Ponderosa Inflatable Crew Module with Pathfinder Geology Lab.
- Added the MC-1000 Buckboard, a container able to hold a variety of different resources.

Do you have what it takes to be a prospector? Then step right up and try your luck with the Gold Digger Portable Mini-Drill! Take core samples for science! Analyze the results! Don't eat the samples.
